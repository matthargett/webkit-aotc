Tests for font loading data collection in ResourceLoadStatistics plist by loading fonts and dumping the entire resource load statistics map. The test tries to load various fonts through a comma separated font-family list to draw a string with many m's since they differ in width more prominently among fonts.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
